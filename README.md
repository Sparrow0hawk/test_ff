# Trying to resolve github actions failures in R

For R v3.5.3 on Xenial Ubuntu I get failures using this workflow when building the package 'ff'. It's unclear exactly why this happens as when trying to recreate this with a vagrantbox I don't get similar failures.

I'll endeavour to troubleshoot in this repository.
